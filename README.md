Type & class scaffolding for roblox classes. Similar to [rbx-dom](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom), but tailored
more to a dynamic, client/server situation instead of being for build tools or programatic manipulation of binary files offline.
Uses rbx-dom for (de)serialization. Please don't look at `build.rs` or pay too much attention to the one example.
